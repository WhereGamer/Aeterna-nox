# About the modpack
If you are already bored with vanilla Minecraft and consider it too easy, and you want a real challenge that will take you dozens of hours to complete, not even for a diamond set, but just for an iron set, then come to us at Aeterna nox.

# In our build, you will see:
1. Almost a full night.
Microtime has been added so that days are counted correctly.

2. Smarter mobs.

3. Zombies and husks can destroy your blocks and build upwards.

4. Undead no longer burn in the sun.

5. Hordes of mobs every DAY.

6. Monsters are no longer blind and can see you from a distance of 2048 blocks.

7. No running (or swimming), fireworks for elites, nametags, or most f3 functions.

8. Random effects on mobs.

9. Monsters can hear you (if you have a microphone).

10. No villages, bastions, strongholds, or destroyed portals.

11. Improved battles with the Wither and Ender Dragon.

12. Improved Pale Garden.ф

13. New and modified crafts, enchantments, and loot tables.
14. No natural regeneration.

15. Endless trading with villagers.

16. Trees can be cut down in one block, but more slowly.

17. New mob types.

18. You have a limit of 100 deaths, and you only have half the HP of vanilla (5 hearts/10 HP).

And much more.

Your main goal is to craft True Netherite armor and tools.
